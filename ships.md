# Private Ships

You can buy private ships, and use those for travel. Since this requires
several expensive and long University courses and at least 210,000 credits
for the cheapest type of ship, this should be considered an advanced feature.

## Prerequisites 

In order to buy a *Private Shuttle*, you need to complete the following
University courses, in this order:

* Introduction to Spaceship Operations (all Universities, 100 Segments)
* Basic Space Navigation (all Universities, 700 Segments)
* Basic Ship Technology (all Universities, 1400 Segments)
* Basic Ship Handling (Spirit of Botswana, 2100 Segments)

(Total cost for courses: 28,200 credits).

If you want to buy a *Razorback* (faster and much more expensive), you will
need these additional courses:

* Advanced Ship Technology (Moissan, 2100 Segments)
* Advanced Ship Handling (Nouveau Limoges, 2800 Segments)

(totalling another 44,800 credits).

## Ship Types

Once you have the prerequisite University courses and enough credits,
you can go to a shipyard and buy a ship. (There are shipyards on The Maid of
Orléans and Orwell Stronghold, but they don't sell any ships.)

The following table shows the available and the planned ship types:

## Operating a Ship

Once you buy a ship, you have to give it a name (length between 3 and
100 characters, Unicode allowed), and then it becomes available at the Docks. A newly
bought ship is fully fueled.

At the Docks, you can enter the ship, and choose a destination. On a Jump Gate,
the destination can be a connected jump gate or a local station. On other stations,
you can just select local destinations.

If you have completed enough
*Multi-Jump Ship Navigation* courses from the *Space Navigation* module, you can
select jump gates that are only indirectly connected to the jump gate
you are on, and travel the whole distance in one go, though slower than
if you stopped at each jump gate and immediately started the next jump.

Using a ship consumes fuel proportionally to the travel distance. You
can refuel at any dock, though the price per fuel depends on the
station, and time. It varies quite a bit (up to a factor of about 8
between lowest and highest price observed on a station), but tends to
be lower on lower-level stations.

The [Tau Tracker shows upper and lower fuel prices per gram that have been observed per station](https://tracker.tauguide.de/fuel).
When you have it installed, it shows current prices, both measured and estimated.

Refueling takes about 315 units per gram, which can add up to several segments
for a large and empty tank.  You can halve
the refueling time by spending 10 bonds.

Partial refueling is not possible, each time you refuel you
fill up to full tank capacity.

There are University courses available to reduce fuel consumption and to
reduce the damage that ships take during normal operation.
The *Basic Fuel Efficiency* course reduces fuel usage by 5%,
and the *Advanced* and *Mastery* course each add another 5% fuel savings.

## Maintenance

Ships require regular patch ups, and occasional overhauls.

Once a health bar of a ship sinks below a certain threshold, or when the
navigation computers are "not operational", the ship requires patch up
before you can fly it again.

If you are lucky, and the current station has a shipyard, the repairs
can be done for you by paid workers, which means you do not have to
be present during the repairs -- but it costs about twice as much as
patching it up yourself.

On stations without a shipyard, you have to patch up your ship at the
docks, which is cheaper, but confines you to the docks during the process.
Patching up a ship consumes 50% Focus, Intelligence and Stamina. During
a ship patch up, stats and focus regeneration is very slow.
While confined, you cannot be attacked (just like if you were confined
to the brig or sickbay).

In either case, you can spend 10 bonds to halve the patch up time.

A patch up only brings the health up to 75%. Overhaul at a shipyard
costs an additional 2000 credits, and completely restores the health
of the ship. You can overhaul your ship without patching it first,
although it will cost more.

## Ship Storage

At every shipyard, you can install a storage locker into a private ship.

This costs around 4,400 to 71,000 credits, depending on the station's economy.

**The installation takes 10 full days**, and halving the time costs 199 bonds.
You cannot use your ship while installation is in progress.

Once installed, you can put items into your ship's locker from inventory,
just like you can with storage lockers in Market.

The storage locker in a Razorback and Private Shuttle has 50 slots.
